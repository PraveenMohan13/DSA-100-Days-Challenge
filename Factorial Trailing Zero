Intuition
The problem seems to involve counting the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given number n. Trailing zeros occur when the product of numbers includes factors of 5 and 2. Since multiples of 2 are more frequent than multiples of 5, counting the number of factors of 5 should be sufficient for this problem.

Approach
The approach used in the provided code is to iteratively divide n by 5 in a while loop and accumulate the result in the res variable. The idea is that each division by 5 accounts for one factor of 5 in the product, and the loop continues until n becomes less than 5.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

Initialize res to 0.
Enter a while loop as long as n is greater than or equal to 5.
Increment res by the result of n/5.
Update n to n/5.
Return the final value of res.
Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of the provided code is O(log n). This is because in each iteration of the while loop, n is divided by 5, and the loop runs until n becomes less than 5. The number of iterations required is logarithmic in n with base 5.
Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space for the res variable. The space required doesn't depend on the input size n.
Code
class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int res=0;
		while(n >= 5){
		    res += n/5;
		    n /= 5;
		}
        return res;
    }
}
